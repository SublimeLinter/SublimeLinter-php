SublimeLinter-php 1.4.0
-----------------------

The 'cmd' setting has finally been removed. As a reminder: the new name for the same thing is 'executable' which is also the common name for all linters in SublimeLinter land.

{
    "SublimeLinter": {
        "linters": {
            "php": {
                "executable": "/path/to/php"
            }
        }
    }
}
